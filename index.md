## <center>Academic Background</center>
<img src="/matriculation-photo-full.jpeg" width="225" class="left-img"/>

I am a PhD student in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge, on the [Health Data Research UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/). I am completing my PhD project as a member of [Inouye Lab](https://www.inouyelab.org/), supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/), [Mike Inouye](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-research-staff/michael-inouye/), and [Sam Lambert](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-research-staff/sam-lambert/). My research interests are in fairness in health data science, especially in personalised medicine and machine learning for medical risk prediction.

Previously, I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/deepmind-scholars-cambridge) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and my research project focused on fairness in machine learning. The photo of me here is from the happy day I matriculated into [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/) College, which is a wonderful college - and not only because of the name!

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham (in Birmingham, UK, which is widely appreciated as the best city in the world). As part of this degree, I also got the opportunity to study abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo as an added bonus. 

After my undergraduate degree, I worked for a couple of years in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds artificial intelligence software for autonomous vehicles. Here, my research focus was on multi-objective optimisation, in particular, the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. 

## <center>Publications</center>
- <b>Axes of prognosis</b>: Working with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China, I collaborated with Emma Whitfield on this project supervised by [Honghan Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HWWUX46) to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis. It was published at the American Medical Informatics Association Annual Symposium 2021 and can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8861682/?report=classic).


## <center>Projects</center>
- <b>HDR UK student-led seminar series</b>: I am a member of the organising committee for the student-led seminar series for my PhD cohort, organising and hosting seminar events. 
- <b> Reinforcement learning for healthcare</b>: I worked on a project as part of my PhD training year wherein I explored various reinforcement learning paradigms, with a particular focus on offline RL and how this can be applied to the problem of multimorbidity trajectory modelling. [Chris Yau](https://cwcyau.github.io/authors/admin/) supervised me on this project.
- <b>ThinkLab NHS sustainability</b>: I am a member of the [University of Cambridge ThinkLab](https://www.thinklab.strategic-partnerships.admin.cam.ac.uk/). We worked on a project with the NHS to improve the delivery of the [NHS Green Plan](https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf) in Cambridgeshire, by creating an actionable solutions and shaping future policies. We produced a report titled "Achieving Net Zero within the NHS: System-wide transition to greener, sustainable care".
- <b>Fairness and the bias-variance trade-off</b>: For my MPhil thesis, I explored bias and variance errors in ML automated decision making in the context of fairness, using data on criminal recidivism. 
- <b>Multi objective journey optimisation</b>: As part of my R&D job, in conjunction with the University of Birmingham, I worked on a project to create an AI journey optimisation system for autonomous vechicles. I am a named inventor on a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) on this topic. I also worked on this for my final-year BSc project, supervised by [Dave Parker](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~parkerdx/index.php), where I was nominated for the research dissertation prize.

## <center>Talks</center>
I am interested in outreach and science communication, and have been involved in both throughout my studies. Here's a couple of talks I've recently given:
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b>: I was invited by [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) to join him in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the [HDR UK bimonthly webinar](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/events/hdr-uk-bimonthly-science-webinar-january-2021/).
- <b>UCL MedTech 2021</b>: I was invited to partake in the [UCL MedTech](https://uclmed.tech/) conference, to share my experiences and research so far in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

### <center>Personal Interests</center>
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/clare-hall-choir). 

I am interested in plants and gardening; due to lockdown, my flat is now half jungle. I also co-run the exciting [Clare Hall Allotment](https://www.instagram.com/clarehallallotment/), and am co-president and co-founder of the [University of Cambridge Allotment Society](https://cam-uni-allotment.github.io/), where we've built a lovely community and are growing all sorts of fruit and vegetables sustainably, as well as donating to local charities. Cooking and eating these is an equally important hobby of mine!

I adore travelling, especially exploring nature (often in my campervan). My other hobbies include hiking, yoga, digital art, photography, and I train in Kung Fu.
