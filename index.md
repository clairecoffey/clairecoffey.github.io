<img src="/clairecoffey_matriculation_photo.jpg" width="225" class="left-img"/>
I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge, on the [Health Data Research UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) in [Inouye Lab](https://www.inouyelab.org/), supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/), [Mike Inouye](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-research-staff/michael-inouye/), and [Sam Lambert](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/samuel-lambert/). My thesis focuses on assessing and improving algorithmic fairness in clinical prediction models, including using polygenic risk scores.

Before my PhD, I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/deepmind-scholars-cambridge) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/). I specialised in AI and ML courses, and my thesis topic was ``Fairness and the bias-variance trade-off". I am a member of [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/) College.

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, with visiting student placements at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo.

After my undergraduate degree, I worked as an AI research consultant, where I joined a start-up company building artificial intelligence software for autonomous vehicles. Here, my research was on the implementation and optimisation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. For this work, I have two patents: [Vehicle Route Guidance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) and [Target Speed Optimisation](https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-publication-getPDF.pdf?PatentNo=GB2555794&DocType=A&JournalNumber=6730).

I especially love the collaborative elements of research, learning from people from with different perspectives - feel free to get in touch for a chat via [Twitter/X](https://x.com/claireicoffey) or e-mail cic31[at]cam.ac.uk!

## <center>Personal Interests</center>
Singing is one of my favourite hobbies, and I am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/music/). Elsewhere, I have been a soloist, lead vocalist, backing vocalist, and chorister in genres ranging from rock to classical! 

I am also passionate about sustainability, and in particular, local sustainability initiatives and growing food. I co-founded the [University of Cambridge Allotment Society](https://cam-uni-allotment.github.io/), where we built a community to grow fruit and vegetables sustainably, and donate excess to local charities. This included writing grant applications for funding, managing the day-to-day running of the allotment, and social media management. 

I love learning new things, meeting new people, and keeping active; I have taken up various hobbies to feed this curiosity. I adore travelling, especially exploring nature! My other hobbies include hiking, dancing (ex-UK freestyle display team), yoga, digital art, and photography. I also train in [Fujian White Crane Kung Fu](https://www.fwckungfu.com/) and rowed in [Clare Hall Boat Club](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/chbc/), where I was social secretary and organised the inaugural international training camp for the club.
