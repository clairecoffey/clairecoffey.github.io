## <center>Academic Background</center>
<img src="/clairecoffey_matriculation_photo.jpg" width="225" class="left-img"/>
I am a PhD candidate in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge, on the [Health Data Research UK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/phd-programme/) in [Inouye Lab](https://www.inouyelab.org/), supervised by [Angela Wood](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/angela-wood/), [Mike Inouye](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-research-staff/michael-inouye/), and [Sam Lambert](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/ceu-group/ceu-senior-academic-staff/samuel-lambert/). My research interests are in assessing and improving fairness in medical prediction algorithms, including in polygenic risk scores, and building machine learning algorithms for fair medical risk prediction.

I was a [DeepMind Scholar](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/deepmind-scholars-cambridge) in MPhil Advanced Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/). My research project focused on the fairness of bias and variance errors in machine learning models. I am a member of [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/) College.

I completed my first-class BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, spending a year abroad at the University of British Columbia and the University of Waterloo.

After my undergraduate degree, I worked in a research and development role for a start-up company that builds artificial intelligence software for autonomous vehicles. Here, my research was on multi-objective optimisation, in particular, the implementation of multi-objective route planning algorithms. For this work, I have two patents: [Vehicle Route Guidance](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190346275A1/en) and [Target Speed Optimisation](https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-publication-getPDF.pdf?PatentNo=GB2555794&DocType=A&JournalNumber=6730).

## <center>Publications</center>
- <b>Axes of prognosis</b>: Working with COVID-19 data from Wuhan, China, I collaborated with Emma Whitfield on this project supervised by [Honghan Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HWWUX46) to identify and predict nuanced subtypes of COVID-19 prognosis. It was published at the American Medical Informatics Association Annual Symposium 2021 and can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8861682/?report=classic) and my presentation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9sfyTnmuE). 
- <b>Achieving Net Zero within the NHS: System-wide transition to greener, sustainable care</b>: As part of the [University of Cambridge ThinkLab](https://www.thinklab.strategic-partnerships.admin.cam.ac.uk/), I worked on a project with the NHS to improve the delivery of the [NHS Green Plan](https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf), by specifying actionable solutions and shaping future policies. Our report can be read [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/335306).

## <center>Projects</center>
- <b>Data Science for Health Equity: statistical methods</b>: I am a member of the [Data Science for Health Equity](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/) community, and organiser of the [statistical methods theme](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/themes/statistical-methods). We organise seminars, run a reading group, and conduct research on statistical methods for health equity. 
- <b> Reinforcement learning for healthcare</b>: I worked on a project wherein I explored various reinforcement learning paradigms with a particular focus on offline RL and how this can be applied to the problem of multimorbidity trajectory modelling. [Chris Yau](https://cwcyau.github.io/authors/admin/) supervised me on this project.
- <b>Fairness and the bias-variance trade-off</b>: For my MPhil thesis, I explored bias and variance errors in ML automated decision making in the context of fairness, using data on criminal recidivism. 
- <b>Multi objective journey optimisation</b>: As part of my R&D job, in conjunction with the University of Birmingham, I worked on a project to create an AI journey optimisation system for autonomous vechicles for for my final-year BSc project, supervised by [Dave Parker](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~parkerdx/index.php). For this I was nominated for the research dissertation prize.

## <center>Talks</center>
I am interested in science communication and public engagement. Here are some of the talks I've been invited to give:
- <b>Cambridge Festival (2023)</b>: At the [Cambridge Festival](https://www.festival.cam.ac.uk/), I gave a talk to members of the public on my research on <i>Fairness in medical risk prediction algorithms</i>. 
- <b>HDR UK Doctoral Immersion Week (2023):</b> As a guest speaker, I presented my research at the HDR UK Doctoral Immersion Week on [https://cwcyau.github.io/hdrukphdcourses/courses/fairness.html](Fairness in healthcare data modelling). 
- <b>HDR UK Bimonthly Webinar</b> (2021): I joined [Peter Diggle](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/diggle/) in a conversation about the HDR UK PhD Programme in the [HDR UK bimonthly webinar](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/bimonthly-one-institute-webinars/).
- <b>UCL MedTech (2021)</b>: I spoke at the [UCL MedTech](https://uclmed.tech/) conference, to share my experiences and research in the hope to inspire undergraduate students at UCL.

## <center>Personal Interests</center>
I really love music and singing, and am a member of [Clare Hall Choir](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/music/). 

I am also interested in gardening; I am co-president and co-founder of the [University of Cambridge Allotment Society](https://cam-uni-allotment.github.io/), where we have built a community to grow fruit and vegetables sustainably, as well as donating to local charities. Cooking and eating these is an equally important hobby of mine!

I adore travelling, especially exploring nature. My other hobbies include hiking, dancing, yoga, digital art, and photography. I also train in [Kung Fu](https://www.fwckungfu.com/) and row in [Clare Hall Boat Club](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/chbc/).
